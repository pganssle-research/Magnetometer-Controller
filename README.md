Magnetometer Controller
=======================

This is a LabWindows (C)-based GUI console for the control and data acquisition systems I built during my graduate studies in Alexander Pines' lab.

The technical details of the system and the program are described in depth in [my thesis](https://github.com/pganssle-research/alkali-vapor-cell-magnetometry-dissertation) ([direct PDF link](https://github.com/pganssle-research/alkali-vapor-cell-magnetometry-dissertation/raw/master/Paul%20Ganssle%20-%20Alkali%20Vapor-Cell%20Magnetometry%20and%20its%20Application%20to%20Low-Field%20Relaxometry%20and%20Diffusometry.pdf)). Chapter 4 of my thesis in particular serves as the current primary documentation for this program.
